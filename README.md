# Movie Recommendation App - README

A movie recomender app that allowed me to get to grips with APIs, Flask, Ngrok, pythonanywhere, HTML templating and a Spacy ML model (which I removed due to space on pythonanywhere). user inputs streaming service, time and min IMDB rating and the model spits out 2 recommendations with links to view trailers on youtube.
